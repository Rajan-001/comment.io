            The YouTube Comment Analyzer is a web-based tool that allows users to input a YouTube video URL and automatically fetch and analyze the comments. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis techniques to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral. The tool also highlights common keywords, identifies trends, filters spam or bot-like activity, and provides data visualizations such as sentiment charts and word clouds.
